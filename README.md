# Task Board
## Project Description

This project is a simple Kanban board for task management. It allows users to add, delete, and move tasks between different status lanes (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) using drag-and-drop functionality. Tasks are displayed as cards, with due dates indicated and dynamically changing colors to reflect their status (past due, due today, or due later). Additionally, the application utilizes local storage to persist tasks between sessions, providing a seamless user experience.
